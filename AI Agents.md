# Agentic Automation
With the traditional automation, we would write code to automate a process and as the edge cases would start to appear, the code would become more and more complex. At the end, we would end up with a very complex code base with multiple edge cases to cover all the scenarios.

On the other hand, with agentic automations, we can show the options/cases instead of drawing the whole map. 

# AI Agents
With regular prompting with a LLM, we need to interact with it and give it feedback in order to make sure that the LLM produces your desired results.
Although through the interactions with LLM we can get a better result, but we also become a blocker. 

With AI agents, we can break that cycle of continous interactions and allow the LLM to operate autonomously.
In other words, when we get an LLM to engage in their thinking process and ask questions and answer them itself so that it can move on and make better decisions by itself.
One thing that makes these agents super powerful is the ability to use tools. Tools allow the agents to interact with the external world.

# Multi Agent Systems
Multi agent systems grow on top of the agent system, where instead of just having one agent, we have multiple of them. 

For example, if we task an agent with something, that agent can also task another agent with a different problem, providing one single final answer in the end. With the multi agent systems, we an customise a single agent 
to don one task as desired. We can also run each agent on a different LLM.
