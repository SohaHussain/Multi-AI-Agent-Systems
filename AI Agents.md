# Agentic Automation
With the traditional automation, we would write code to automate a process and as the edge cases would start to appear, the code would become more and more complex. At the end, we would end up with a very complex code base with multiple edge cases to cover all the scenarios.

On the other hand, with agentic automations, we can show the options/cases instead of drawing the whole map.
